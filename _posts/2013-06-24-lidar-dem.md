This post is about using special DEM data for map creation. If you have no clue what DEM data is, read the [article on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_elevation_model) first.

I use Maperitive to create [my own map](https://www.thasler.com/map "MyCycleMap"),  optimized for hiking/biking. Right now, Maperitive uses SRTM-1 and  SRTM-3 DEM data (HGT-Files). A decent description of SRTM-files can be found at [vterrain.org](http://vterrain.org/Elevation/SRTM/).

The Austrian Government ([Land Tirol](http://data.tirol.gv.at)) has published high-resolution DEM data (TIRIS) derived from [airborne laser scans](http://www.tirol.gv.at/themen/sicherheit/geoinformation/laserscanning/) (LIDAR) over their territory. This TIRIS-data has a resolution of 10m, which is 3-4 times more accurate than other existing SRTM-1 DEM data. The most accurate SRTM-1 data (I have found) for Tyrol is available on  Jonathan de Ferrantis website [Viewfinder Panoramas](http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/dem3.html#alps).

Here is a comparison (note the detailed rendering of the roads/rivers on the right image):

The goal of this article is to use this data as source for all DEM-related operations like hill-shading or contour lines with [Maperitive](http://maperitive.net).

## Preparations

First of all, we need the DEM data from Tyrol. It can be obtained from [this page](http://www.tirol.gv.at/applikationen/e-government/data/datenkatalog/geographie-und-planung/digitales-gelaendemodell-tirol/). Download and unzip into one folder (skip "Bezirk Innsbruck" it's a subset of "Bezirk Innsbruck-Land"). There should be 8 files named "*_10m_float.asc".

The TIRIS data format is Arcinfo ASCII-Grid which is more or less a plain text file with height information (details later). Maperitive cannot use it. We need to convert this data to an SRTM-1 HGT file. That's why we need to set up a working [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org) environment. Visit the [GDAL-website](http://www.gdal.org) and follow their installation instructions for your environment. Make sure you also install the _proj_-package (including development-files) in a linux environment.  We will need the [gdal_translate](http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/UserDocs/GdalTranslate) and [gdalwarp](http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/UserDocs/GdalWarp) tools.

To merge the TIRIS data with an existing SRTM1-tile please grab a copy at the [viewfinder website](http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/dem3.html#alps). In this example I will use the file N47E011.hgt tile. It covers the region around Innsbruck.

I use an [OpenSuse](http://www.opensuse.org/) installation within a [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) for the GDAL-Toolkit. You can get an OpenSuse image [here](http://virtualboxes.org/images/opensuse/). You may also need a shared folder in OpenSuse for data exchange to the host computer. If you have problems setting up your environment, let me know.

That was the most boring part. Now lets have a look at the DEM data itself.

## TIRIS DEM data

Here are some key facts about the DEM data the Austrian government of Tyrol provides:

*   Data format: Arcinfo ASCII-Grid
*   Datatype: Float32
*   Resolution: 10m x 10m.
*   Projection: [Transverse Mercator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_Mercator_projection) (EPSG 31254).
See "Informationsblatt.txt" provided with every zip-file for more details.

To get an idea how impressive (meaning accurate) the TIRIS data is, you should have a look at it first (Scale: 1 pixel=10m):

To visualize the raw DEM-data I recommend [GlobalMapper](http://www.bluemarblegeo.com/products/global-mapper.php). The unregistered ("free") version can load and display most DEM formats including the Arc ASCII Grid. However, the "free" version cannot save any data. But that's no problem, since we have GDAL at hand.

You can also give [VTBuilder](http://vterrain.org/Doc/VTBuilder/overview.html) a try. It has similar visualization functionality and is also able to save data. However, I was not able to convert the TIRIS data into SRTM format without offset errors in the resulting SRTM1-HGT file.

## Converting to SRTM-1

This is the complete shell script to convert the TIRIS DEM data into STRM1-HGT:

```sh
# create backup of original SRTM1-HGT file
cp N47E011.hgt N47E011.old

# convert original STRM1 to TIFF
gdal_translate N47E011.hgt N47E011.tif

# convert and merge all TIRIS data to one TIFF
gdalwarp -s_srs EPSG:31254 -t_srs EPSG:4326 -srcnodata -9999 -r bilinear 
         -overwrite -te 11.0 47.0 12.0 48.0 -ts 3601 3601 -order 3 -et 0.0 
         -wt Float32 -wo SAMPLE_STEPS=100 -dstnodata none *10m_float.asc N47E011_tiris.tif

# merge TIRIS-TIFF into old SRTM1 data
gdalwarp -s_srs EPSG:4326 -t_srs EPSG:4326 -r bilinear -order 3 -et 0.0 
         -wt Float32 -wo SAMPLE_STEPS=100 N47E011_tiris.tif N47E011.tif

# convert result back to SRTM1 (overwrite original file)
gdal_translate -of SRTMHGT N47E011.tif N47E011.hgt
```

Let's get step by step through the script:

<span style="color: #ff00ff;">cp</span> <span style="color: #008000;">N47E011.hgt</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">N47E011.old</span>

Creates (<span style="color: #ff00ff;">copy</span>) a <span style="color: #0000ff;">backup</span> of the <span style="color: #008000;">original </span>SRTM1 data. In case you want to use the original file later for another purpose.

<span style="color: #000000;">gdal_translate</span> <span style="color: #008000;">N47E011.hgt</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">N47E011.tif</span>

Use gdal_translate to convert the <span style="color: #008000;">original SRTM1-HGT</span> data into <span style="color: #0000ff;">GeoTIFF format</span>. We need this to merge the new data derived from the TIRIS DEM into the existing SRTM data.

<span style="color: #000000;">gdalwarp <span style="color: #ff00ff;">-s_srs EPSG:31254 -t_srs EPSG:4326</span> <span style="color: #ff6600;">-srcnodata -9999 -dstnodata none</span> 
<span style="color: #008000;">-overwrite</span> <span style="color: #33cccc;">-te 11.0 47.0 12.0 48.0 -ts 3601 3601</span> 
<span style="color: #0000ff;">-r bilinear -order 3</span><span style="color: #993366;"> -et 0.0 -wt Float32 -wo SAMPLE_STEPS=100</span> 
*10m_float.asc N47E011_tiris.tif</span>

With this mighty command, you grab every TIRIS file (<span style="color: #000000;">*10m_float.asc</span>) and convert in into a GeoTIFF. During this process, we define the <span style="color: #ff00ff;">source and target projection</span>, tell the converter to <span style="color: #ff6600;">skip non existent data represented as -9999m</span> above sea level in our source file. In case there is already an existing GeoTIFF, we will <span style="color: #008000;">overwrite</span> it. It also needs to know what <span style="color: #33cccc;">SRTM-tile</span> we are going to be in (<span style="color: #33cccc;">lower-left-upper-right window</span>) and what the <span style="color: #33cccc;">target resolution</span> we want. Note that the resolution of SRTM1 data is <span style="color: #33cccc;">3601x3601</span>. We can't do better here. That is also the reason why we need to rescale the input data with a <span style="color: #0000ff;">bilinear 3rd order</span> filter. The <span style="color: #800080;">red</span> parts should set <span style="color: #800080;">reprojection quality to high</span> but I'm not sure they do anything at all.

Ok, here comes the tricky part:

gdalwarp <span style="color: #ff00ff;">-s_srs EPSG:4326 -t_srs EPSG:4326</span> <span style="color: #339966;">-r bilinear -order 3 -et 0.0 </span>
<span style="color: #339966;">-wt Float32 -wo SAMPLE_STEPS=100</span> N47E011_tiris.tif N47E011.tif

It's almost the same as the command before except it isn't. Note that the -overwrite option is not set. This command merges the current SRTM1-file (the tif we created with the second command from a hgt-file) with our converted TIRIS-data. The new (=better) data is copied into the old file where available. Other parts remain the same as in the original file:

![](/img/blog/merging_srtm2.jpg)

The last command converts the tif back to a SRTM1-hgt file: 

```sh
gdal_translate -of SRTMHGT N47E011.tif N47E011.hgt
```

That's it. We have our updated hgt-file based on high-precision LIDAR-DEM data.

## Covering Tyrol

The above script is just an example an depends on hard-coded coordinates and tiles. Therefore I have to create a more complex script that covers all of the affected tiles for Tyrol (coming soon).
